# Project-A-Text-Analysis-of-Trump-s-Tweets

This tweet: https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/762005541388378112 containing a hypothesis about Donald Trump's Twitter account needs to be investigated with data:

Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff).

Every hyperbolic tweet is from Android (from him).

Others have explored Trump’s timeline: https://www.cnet.com/news/trumps-tweets-android-for-nasty-iphone-for-nice/ and noticed this tends to hold up. And Trump himself did indeed tweet from a Samsung Galaxy https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/5/9453935/donald-trump-twitter-strategy until March 2017 https://www.vox.com/2017/5/27/15705090/president-donald-trump-twitter-android-iphone-ios-samsung-galaxy-security-hacking. But how could it be examined quantitatively? In this project, you will apply text mining and sentiment analysis to determine whether or not Trump does indeed write the angrier, Android tweets

The dataset used in this project is from The Trump Twitter Archive by Brendan Brown, which contains all 35,000+ tweets from the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/ from 2009 (the year Trump sent his first tweet https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-first-tweet-2017-5?r=DE&IR=T) through 2018.
